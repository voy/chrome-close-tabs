# TabEraser

A Chrome plugin, which adds enhanced tab closing capabilities.

Originally created by guys from Tejji.com. I found their work and missing a feature
I ended up rewriting it completely, eventually in TypeScript.

To build and test `npm run test` and `npm run build` are your friends.

The icon used is from the Oxygen Icon set by the Oxygen Team.
