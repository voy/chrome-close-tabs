# Close Tabs (Enhanced Edition)

A Chrome plugin adding enhanced tab closing capabilities

Close Tabs was originally created by guys from Tejji.com. I found in on the 
Chrome store and was missing a feature, namely to close all tabs from
the currect tab's domain except for the current tab. The authors weren't
responding and there is no repo on GitHub for the plugin, so I wasn't able
to contribute my patches back. I rewrote the plugin and added my new 
functionality, but of course the credit to its original authors.

You will need mocha and sinon to run tests:

    $ npm install -g mocha
    $ npm install -g sinon

The icon used is from the Oxygen Icon set by the Oxygen Team.
